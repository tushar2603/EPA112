    "### Chosen Sustainable Development Goals (SDG's)\n",

    "### Problem statement and research questions\n",
    "While there has been some progress towards reaching global nutrition goals, almost nine percent of the population in Asia was malnourished in 2022. This region also accounts for half of the world's undernourished people, and there are more severely food insecure individuals in Southern Asia than any other subregions in the world. [3] At the same time, Asia can be characterised as a region with high levels of income inequality, especially in South Asia and East Asia. It is known that high income inequality can have significant negative effects on many different factors. [4] In this analysis, we will specifically focus on the effect of income inequality on undernourishment in Asia. In order to analyse this, the following <b>general research question</b> has been formulated: \n",
    "\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "<i>What is the relation between economic and social inequality and undernourishment in Asian countries, and can we predict the rate of undernourishment in Asian countries in the coming 20 years based on economic and social inequality? </i>\n",
    "<br />\n",
    "\n",
    "<br /> \n",
    "In order to quantify and eventually answer the general research question, the following <b>specific research questions</b> have been formulated:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. <i> What are the trends in income inequality in Asian countries in the period of 2000-2020? Will income inequality rise in the next 20 years based on this trend? </i>\n",
    "2. <i> What are the trends in undernourishment in Asian countries in the period of 2000-2020? Will undernourishment rise in the next 20 years based on this trend? </i>\n",
    "3. <i> How will undernourishment change based on the income inequality in Asian countries in the next 20 years? </i>\n",
    "4. <i> Do gender equality, education attainment and literacy rates have an influence on the undernourishment in Asian countries? </i>\n",
